# adding-react-to-html

In this project, I learnt to use the `useState` hook. Each button in the HTML changes/ adds some state to the page as per their description.
Primarily, I was focusing on learning how I can add a splash of react code to a simple static page and it worked successfully.
That said, I was a bit concerned about the performmance and speed of the page after adding react. It seemed to load slower. It could also be issues with slow internet...
